v2 - After working through previous versions, and finding what works, it's my style to burn everything to the ground and build again on a solid foundation of what works.

This is the first major revision, and due to too much cruft in v1

Since this is a large project, I fully expect to get to double-digit versions before considering it reasonably good.
