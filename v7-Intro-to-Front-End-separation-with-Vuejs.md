v7 - After working through previous versions, and finding working solutions, it's my style to burn everything to the ground and build again on a solid foundation of what works.

This version is mainly the result of soming across Vue.Js, which answered my unvoiced concerns while working with Rails. Namely: how to keep the code clean while being able to reuse visual elements, how to present a "Single Page Application" that is fast and flexible, and how to deal with the looming spaghetti code that was coming from making views and logic work together.

The idea is to use rails to just present the API, then have Vue.Js be the interface.



*Since this is a large project, I fully expect to get to double-digit versions before considering it reasonably good.*
