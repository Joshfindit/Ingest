v6 - After working through previous versions, and finding what works, it's my style to burn everything to the ground and build again on a solid foundation of what works.

This version is mainly the result of refining the [rails generators](https://github.com/Joshfindit/Semantic-Scaffold-for-Neo4j) to support Semantic-UI, neo4j, and my coding style. Once those scripts were at a good place, I used them to create v6.

Since this is a large project, I fully expect to get to double-digit versions before considering it reasonably good.
